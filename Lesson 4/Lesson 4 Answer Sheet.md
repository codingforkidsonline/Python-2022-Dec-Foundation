# Question 1 Answer:
a = 187
b = 874
c = 438

result = a + b - c
print(result)



# Question 2 Answer:
a = 15
b = 24
c = 8
d = 4

result = a - b * 2 / (c + d)
print("The result of a-b*2/(c+d) is:", result)



# Question 3 Answer:
a = 20
b = 6

remainder = a % b
print("The remainder of a is divided by b is:", remainder)



# Question 4 Answer:
a = 13
square = a * a
# square = a ** 2

print(square)

# Question 5 Answer:
x = 31
y = 41

print("x is greater than y:", x > y)
print("x is less than y:", x < y)
print("x is equal to y:", x == y)



# Question 6 Answer:
import math

area = math.pi * 10 ** 2
print(area)



# Question 7 Answer:
